# Environmental-Classification-based-on-Gaming-Patterns

## Aim 
The aim of this project is to create a more nuanced understanding of the interactions between socio-demographic characteristics, in-game behaviours, and global-scale environmental consciousness. 

## About the Dataset 
The dataset used contains a wide range of information, including socio-demographic details, responses to world events, environmental viewpoints, gaming habits, in-game activities, and player emotional experiences. This dataset is a significant resource for investigating the global convergence of virtual gaming, environmental awareness, and human actions. 

## Methodology
Our methodology is divided into three stages: 
  1. Data quality checks - The aim of data quality assessment is to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the dataset by identifying and rectifying discrepancies.
  2. Data characterization - The data characterization phase seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of key characteristics, patterns, and trends within the dataset.
  3. Detailed analysis objectives -  The detailed analysis is for conducting an in-depth examination of the dataset, extracting valuable insights and conclusions.
